Requirements
------------
A fortran compiler, e.g. gfortran.

Compile
-------
If using gfortran, you can just run:
$ make
otherwise, compile 'cholesky.f90' with your favorite compiler.

Run
---
By default, compilation produces 'a.out'. Just run:
$ ./a.out
You will be prompted to enter the value for n.
Alternatively, you can run the program by piping
the desired value of n to the executable:
$ echo "2" | ./a.out
The results are printed to stdout.
