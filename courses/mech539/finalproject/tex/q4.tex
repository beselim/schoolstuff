Solver Parameters:
\begin{description}[noitemsep]
    \item[Timestepping Scheme:] Euler Explicit
    \item[CFL:] 0.4
    \item[Grid Points:] 100
    \item[$\epsilon$:] 0.4
    \item[\pexit:] $0.72 p_t$

Nomenclature:
\begin{description}[noitemsep]
    \item[SD:] Scalar Dissipation
    \item[SW:] Steger-Warming
    \item[MSW:] Modified Steger-Warming
    \item[CMSW:] Corrected-Modified Steger-Warming
    \item[Roe:] Roe
\end{description}

Results are shown in~\Cref{fig:q4}. The following can be observed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SD is the most dissipative out of all the schemes since it leads to the smoothest
        shock. SW is the second most dissipative. MSW tries to correct for the latter
        but results in a lack of dissipation and significant wiggles.
        CMSW fixes this and leads to a relatively
        good solution but still produces some wiggles around the shock. Finally, Roe
        can be seen to be the best scheme.
    \item A very noticeable bump can be observed in the SW solution right when the flow
        turns supersonic. This is due to the lack of continuity from switching to
        $A_+$ to $A_-$, although it is possible that $\epsilon$ was too small
        in this case.
    \item While CMSW is the best Steger-Warming scheme, it is also the most time-consuming
        since it involves usage of both SW and MSW. However, less iterations are required
        than MSW but more than SW.
    \item SD takes the least amount of time and iterations.
    \item Roe takes more iterations than Sw, but less than CMSW. However, it is much quicker
        in terms of time.
\end{itemize}
Overall, Roe is the best scheme when considering accuracy, iterations/time taken to
converge and shock sharpness.

Total pressure loss is tabulated in~\Cref{tab:q4_ploss}. Roe, CMSW and MSw show the
same pressure loss since they most accurately capture the shock intensity.
