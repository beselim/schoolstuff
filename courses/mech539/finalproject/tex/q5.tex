\section{Temporal discretization scheme study}
Solver Parameters:
\begin{description}[noitemsep]
    \item[Spatial Scheme:] Roe
    \item[CFL:] 0.4
    \item[Grid Points:] 100
    \item[\pexit:] $0.72 p_t$
\end{description}
The convergence of density residual is shown in~\Cref{fig:q5}. It should be
noted that $\Delta t$ was the same for both schemes. While Euler explicit
takes slightly more iterations to converge, each iteration is much less costly and thus
less total time is taken. This goes to show that sometimes the simplest schemes are
good enough.

However, the maximum allowable $\Delta t$ is higher for Jameson's. This is tabulated
in~\Cref{tab:q5} in terms of CFL number. Still, Euler is faster even with its lower
CFL limit.
\begin{table}[H]

    \caption{Effect of timestepping scheme on maximum allowable CFL and
        CPU time taken to converge with that CFL. The CFL was incremented in
        steps of 0.05.}
    \label{tab:q5}
    \input{table_q5}
\end{table}

It would be interesting to compare the accuracy of Jameson and Euler explicit with similar
CPU times. In other words, one must wonder ``how accurate a solution can I get in a given
time?''. However, no exact solution is available (or requested) for this project.
