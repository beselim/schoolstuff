    abstract = {This paper presents a review on the numerical solution of the Euler equations. Three different high resolution versions of the following schemes are considered: Roe's scheme, the HLLE scheme and the AUSM+ scheme. We present a variety of test cases, each designed to test the robustness of each scheme and compare the results to determine which scheme was the most accurate.},
