\section{Question 3}
The code has been handed in with this report, and is actually the same code as for
the second question of the project, only with the evaluation of 2D element stifness
matrices. To run the code, add the \texttt{src} folder to your MATLAB path, navigate
to the \texttt{ass5q3} directory in the MATLAB command window and run \texttt{main}.

The displacements (in inches) are given by:
\begin{gather*}
    U_1 = U_2 = 0; \quad U_3 = 0.0107; \quad U_4 = -0.0258;\\
    U_5 = 0.0258; \quad U_6 = -0.0258; \quad U_7 = 0.0213; U_8 = 0
\end{gather*}
and the forces in each member (in pounds) are given by:
\begin{equation*}
    F_{12} = 8000; \quad F_{13} = F_{23} = 0; \quad F_{24} = -8000; \quad F_{34} = 11314
\end{equation*}
